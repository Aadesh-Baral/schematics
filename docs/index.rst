.. rubric:: Data Structures for Humansâ„¢.

Schematics is a Python library to validate, manipulate, and serialize data
structures. The internals are a lot like form libraries such as WTForms or
Django forms, but Schematics is geared towards richer data structures like
JSON.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

+ Create data structures for very specific types of data.
+ Convert structures to and from different formats, like JSON or a simple dict.
+ Validate API inputs.
+ Serialize data with / without fields, depending on how you're using it.
+ Define message formats for communications protocols, like an RPC.
+ Customer persistence layers.
