Schematics
==========

**Data Structures for Humansâ„¢.**

Schematics is a Python library to validate, manipulate, and serialize data
structures. The internals are a lot like form libraries such as WTForms or
Django forms, but Schematics is geared towards richer data structures like
JSON.

**Use Cases**

+ Create flexible data structures with typed fields.
+ Convert structures to and from different formats, like JSON.
+ Serialize data with / without fields, depending on who will receive it.
+ Validate API inputs
+ Define message formats for communications protocols, eg. an RPC.
+ Get all the goodness of an ORM with the flexibility to easily write queries
  by hand.
