User's Guide
------------

Schematics is built upon a few concepts working together.  We start by defining
a type of data.  We then put multiple types together into a data model.  Then
we validate data against our model.  And from there we can reduce the data into
something we can put in a database or send another machine in a message,
knowing our data looks exactly the way we need it.

API Reference
-------------

The documentation above provides the high-level concepts.  The code itself
provides the best reference.

The Schematics community writes code comments to describe the intended
behavior.  That translates well into low-level documentation.
