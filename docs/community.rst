Community
=========

Schematics was born in Brooklyn, NY by `James Dennis <http://j2labs.io>`_.
Over time, people from around the world have contributed code.

Special thanks to `Hacker School <http://hackerschool.com>`_, `Plain Vanilla
<http://www.plainvanilla.is/>`_, `Quantopian <http://quantopian.com>`_, `Apple
<http://apple.com>`_, and the open source community for contributing to
Schematics.

We work almost entirely via github and a mailing list.


GitHub
------

We track bugs, feature requests, and documentation requests with `Github Issues
<https://github.com/j2labs/schematics/issues>`_.


Mailing list
------------

We discuss the future of Schematics and upcoming changes in detail on
`schematics-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/schematics-dev>`_.

If you've read the documentation and still haven't found the answer you're
looking for, you should reach out to us here too.
