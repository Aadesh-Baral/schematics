Schematics was born in Brooklyn, NY by `James Dennis <http://j2labs.io>`_.
Over time, people from around the world have contributed code.  We work almost
entirely via github and a mailing list.

<http://www.plainvanilla.is/>`_, `Quantopian <http://quantopian.com>`_, `Apple

everyone who has contributed ideas or code to this project.


GitHub
------

We track bugs, feature requests, and documentation requests with `Github Issues
<https://github.com/j2labs/schematics/issues>`_.


Mailing list
------------

We discuss the future of Schematics and upcoming changes in detail on
`schematics-dev <http://groups.google.com/group/schematics-dev>`_.
